                        Hello, my name is Robby Heenan. I am 23 years old and fairly new to coding, although I have been teaching myself for about a year
                    I am currently in the Georgia Tech coding bootcamp to gain the skills and abilities neccesary to be employed as a web developer, and ultimately
                    to start my own company. I am mainly interested in social media, but everything about the web fascinates me.
                </p>
                <br>
                        My other hobbies include videogames, movies, lacrosse, and my dog. My number one game is Overwatch. My favorite movies are Sci-Fi. 
                    I played lacrosse pretty much my whole life. My dog Boudicca is the most gorgeous mutt ever.
